# WatchFlow: A/B Testing & Funnel Optimization 

##  Overview
This project simulates a video streaming app and analyzes user behavior across a typical engagement funnel using only SQL. It includes funnel construction, drop-off analysis, and A/B testing for a new vertical-scroll layout.

## Key Goals
- Funnel conversion: visit â†’ watch_start â†’ watch_complete â†’ like/share
- Drop-off rate analysis
- A/B testing (control vs test group impact)
- Segmentation by user type: new vs returning

## Dataset
- Synthetic data generated with 500 users, 1000 sessions
- Columns: user_id, session_id, event_time, event_type, content_id, group
